### find that file that's somewhere in this directory
```bash
ls -R "$directory" | grep -H "$search_term"
```

1. `ls -R "$directory"`: This command lists the contents of the directory specified by the variable `$directory` and all of its subdirectories. The `ls` command is used in Unix-like operating systems to list files and directories. The `-R` option tells `ls` to list files recursively.

2. `|`: This is a pipe symbol, which is used to pass the output of one command (in this case, `ls "$directory"`) as input to another command (in this case, `grep -H "$search_term"`).

3. `grep -H "$search_term"`: The `grep` command is used to search for a specific pattern in the input it receives. In this case, it's searching for the pattern specified by the variable `$search_term`. The `-H` option tells `grep` to print the filename along with the matching line.

So, the overall purpose of this command is to list the files in a specific directory and then search for a specific term within those filenames. If a filename contains the search term, the filename is printed to the console.

#### more greppy stuff
```bash
ls -R "$directory" | xargs -I {} grep -H "$search_term" "$directory/{}"
```

1. `ls "$directory"`: This command lists the contents of the directory specified by the variable `$directory`. The `ls` command is commonly used to list files and directories in Unix-like operating systems.

2. `|`: This is a pipe symbol, which is used to redirect the output of one command to another command. In this case, it takes the output of the `ls` command and passes it as input to the next command.

3. `xargs -I {}`: The `xargs` command reads items from standard input (in this case, the output of the previous command) and executes a specified command with those items as arguments. The `-I {}` option tells `xargs` to replace occurrences of `{}` in the command with the input items.

4. `grep -H "$search_term" "$directory/{}"`: The `grep` command is used to search for patterns in files. In this case, it searches for the `$search_term` within the files in the directory specified by `$directory/{}`. The `-H` option tells `grep` to print the filename along with the matching line.

So, the overall purpose of this command is to search for a specific term (`$search_term`) within the files in a given directory (`$directory`). It achieves this by listing the files in the directory, and then using `xargs` to pass each file as an argument to `grep` for searching.
